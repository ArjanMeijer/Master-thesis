\header{Abstract}
Over the last few years, word embeddings have taken a dominant position in the Information Retrieval domain. Many studies have been done concerning the quality of word embeddings on general texts, such as wikipedia or review-websites. Giving promising results, the word embeddings have been studied and improved over resent years. However, these studies have been focused on generic text, overlooking the complexity of in-domain knowledge, such as rare domain specific words. This research focusses on the usefulness of word embeddings on domain specific texts, concerning scientific articles which have been published in 2017. This research compares the word embeddings  the TF-IDF algorithm on a corpus existing on a wide range of domain specific texts.
