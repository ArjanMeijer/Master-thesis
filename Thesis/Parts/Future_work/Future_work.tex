- How do unique token count, token count and vocabulary size relate for TF-IDF?
- Can high quality word similarity sets be created from embedding for future benchmarking?
- Can embeddings give a visual representation of the evolution of scientific research over time?
- Does TF-IDF improve when top-occurring words are cut-off?
