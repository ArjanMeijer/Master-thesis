\header{Conclusion}
This research shows that the article embeddings, created with word embeddings, perform better than the reasonable TF-IDF alternatives for our categorization task, based on article titles. The TF-IDF alternatives give better results than the embeddings based on abstracts. The performance of the embeddings have been improved by weighting them with the TF-IDF values on word level. This improved embedding results in a median rank decrease of 8 on title and an median rank increase of 8 on title, compared to the best performing TF-IDF alternative.  The embedding also results in a memory decrease of 73.04\% making it more viable to keep it in memory.
We have furthermore shown that limiting vocabulary size to exclude rare words or common words decreases the performance of the embeddings. We thus come to the following conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Article based embeddings perform better than TF-IDF on titles, small texts, which contain limited information}
\item{TF-IDF performs better than article based embeddings on abstracts, larger texts, which contain more information}
\item{Embeddings give a significant decrease in memory usage compared to TF-IDF}
\end{enumerate}
