Dependency parsing could be used to reduce the amount of words in a sentence/document.
Only defining words are needed that capture the essense of a centence.

Using word embedding on these reduced sets may decrease training time without influencing
the accuracy of the catigorization task, since it perserves the 'essense' of the sentences.

Reduction options: cut all leaves
