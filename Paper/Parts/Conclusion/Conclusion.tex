\header{Conclusion}
This research shows that the article embeddings, created with word embeddings, perform better than the reasonable TF-IDF alternatives on our categorization task, based on article titles. The TF-IDF alternatives give better results than the embeddings based on abstracts. The performance of the embeddings have been improved by weighing them with the TF-IDF values on the word level, although this improvement cannot be seen as significant on our dataset. This improved embedding set results in a median rank decrease of 8 on the titles and a median rank increase of 8 on the abstract, compared to the best performing TF-IDF alternative.  The embedding also results in a memory decrease of 73.04\% compared to the best performing TF-IDF alternative, making it more viable to keep it in memory. The visualization of the journal embedding shows that similar journals are grouped together, indicating a preservation of relatedness between the journal embeddings. We thus come to the following conclusions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Article based embeddings perform better than TF-IDF on titles, i.e. small texts which contain limited information}
\item{TF-IDF performs better than article based embeddings on abstracts, i.e. larger texts which contain more information}
\item{Embeddings give a significant decrease in memory usage compared to TF-IDF}
\item{Visualization of the journal embeddings show that the embeddings capture and preserve subject relatedness when they are combined to create embeddings for larger texts}

\end{enumerate}
